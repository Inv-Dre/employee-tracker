## Description
I created the employee tracker to help businesses keep track of their employee databases.
The user is prompted with a list where they are asked what action that want to do. The tracker then asks the user a series of question depending on their initial request.
The user can view and add departments, employees, roles. The last thing it does it update roles.

## Installation

1. git clone this in your terminal
https://github.com/Inv-Dre/employee-tracker.git

2. Open up the folder

3. Type npm i into your terminal and hit enter
